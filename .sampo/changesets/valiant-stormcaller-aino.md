cargo/maudit: minor

Added support for prefetching links. By default, Maudit will now automatically prefetch links your users press on in order to increase the performance of page navigations.

Other, more aggressive strategies for prefetching are also available: Hover and Viewport, which respectively prefetch links on hover and all links in the viewport.
