title: "Manual installation"
description: "While it is recommended to use the CLI tool to create and manage Maudit projects, it is also possible to manually install Maudit like any other Rust library."
---

Create a new Rust project using Cargo, specifying the `--bin` flag to create a binary project:

```bash
cargo new my-website --bin
cd my-website
```

Next, add Maudit as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file, or run `cargo add maudit` to do so automatically:

```toml
[dependencies]
maudit = "0.1"
```

Voil√†! You can now use Maudit in your project. Check out the rest of the [documentation](/docs) for more information on how to use Maudit, or if you prefer jumping straght into the code, take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/Princesseuh/maudit/tree/main/examples).
