Welcome to the Maudit documentation! Maudit (pronounced /mo.di/, meaning _cursed_ in French) is a static site generator.

[Static site generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) are tools that take a collection of files and convert them into a website, once in a build step. This is in contrast to dynamic websites, which are generated on-the-fly by a server. Other similar tools include [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), [Astro](https://astro.build), [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) and [many more](https://jamstack.org/generators/).

Maudit aims to be a simple and easy-to-use static site generator, [nothing more](/docs/philosophy/#maudit-is-about-making-static-websites). We hope that you'll find it useful for your projects, and we're excited to see what you'll create with it!

### Audience

This documentation assumes basic knowledge of web development (e.g. HTML and CSS) and Rust. If you are new to web development, we recommend checking out the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) and for Rust, the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

Having said that, we do try to make the documentation approchable for beginners, and concepts will generally be explained as they are introduced.
